# The Genshin Gaugedle, also known as ICDle
An idea by [Zajef77](https://www.twitch.tv/zajef77), 
to have a Genshindle like guessing game, where the player guesses Genshin impact characters based on information about them, but based on more niche information related to TC (Theorycrafting). 
Zajef created an Excel spreadsheet where he collected those datapoints related to character's abilities and tried to make a kind of playable game inside the spreadsheet.
I thought it would be very cool to have an actual website for this game, similar to sites like [genshindle.com](https://www.genshindle.com),
so I took the spreadsheet that Zajef provided and created the Genshin Gaugedle.
